Version 1.181226.20183.01.01
-------------------------
Description
	This version focused on creating a basic scene for development testing, implementing basic entity AI (both a tracking entity and a following entity), implementing gun firing, and basic decreasing of entity and player health. A developer's console has been created as well for future development purposes.
Tasks Completed
	Create demo scene
	Create weapon class
	Create pistol class
	Test pistol firing mechanism
	Create entity class
	Create RFTO class
	Test RTFO receiving damage
	Create player class
	Implement sight cone for entity
	Test player receiving damage
	Implement / Test turret object tracking player
	Implement / Test turret only tracking player if in range/in sight cone
	Implement weapon fire rate (pistol only can fire on ButtonDown and only if timer is greater than fire rate)
	Implement ammo (pistol can only fire if enough ammo present)
	Implement entity fire rate (changes how sight cone works)
	Implement entity that follows player (only in range/in sight cone) and does damage
	Fully create demo scene testing these implementations on a larger scale
	Implement particle/sound effects, distinction materials on entities and gun
	Create development console (takes in commands, splits strings, etc.)
