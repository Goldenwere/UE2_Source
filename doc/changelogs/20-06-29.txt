Version 1.20194.05.01
-------------------------
Description
	This version focused on improving entity AI and other smaller improvements/bug fixes
Tasks Completed
	Add box colliders / Room tag to room prefabs and grouped halls
	Add awareness of CurrentRoom to ICharacter; Entity (OnPlayerSpawned) and PlayerStats (Start) grab CurrentRoom using ClosestPointToBounds, MobileEntity and PlayerStats update CurrentRoom via OnTriggerEntered
	Add kinematic rigidbody to mobile entity prefabs, allows triggering of doors and to grab CurrentRoom
	Add line of sight to PHE and stationary entities to make firing seem more intelligent; AoE entities now only fire when player in range of their attack
	Vertically unlocked properly implemented for PHE
	Entities stay on same level as player if needed and won't leave the room (in these instances, their random spot becomes the player's position)
	Reflection probe optimizations (entity probes only render when player in same room as entity (stationary entity renders only when player spawns), and spread work via Individual Faces)
	Dev console now has font used in rest of project, displays history, and uses 2D Rect Mask instead of Mask+Image to properly mask at runtime
	Implement unlock requisites for doors
	Improve door lock indicator materials for better visibility and for color-blind friendliness
	Fix bugs 9 (mouse invert not implemented), 10 (no device prevention for binding controls), & 11 (incorrect/outdated icon in build)
	Add antialias setting
	Add animation to PHE
	Change pistol sound, edit turret and AoE entity sounds
	Doors aware of object destruction to prevent stuck-open doors; perform periodic cleanup (render reflections + check for destroyed objects), and open with faster acceleration
	Console command for showing FPS
	Mobile entities alert each other when taking damage

Version 1.20192.03.02
-------------------------
Description
	This version focused on improving entity AI
Tasks Completed
	Random entity movement
	Entity awareness after being attacked
	Entity semi-awareness (further distance than full awareness)
	Speed differences between awareness and semi/wandering
	Moved firing mechanisms to dedicated methods in entity AI
	PHE now faces toward player better, leading to a much higher success rate of hits/damage
	PHE now 80% of the time prefers firing from different positions rather than directly going toward player
	Changed PHE firing sound
	Halved base entity reaction time (0.1 to 0.05, the number multiplied by player distance)
	PHE firing no longer depends on isFollowing (which caused short pauses every time UpdateDestination needed to be called) - now depends on new lost track timer / delay
	Changed some PHE AI code to fix issues that arose mixing existing behavor with added behavor
	Implemented new crosshair, change color when hovering over entity
	Fixed a bug with target-HUD (raycast did forward of player object, which always faced horizontally outward, did not take camera up-down into account)
	Fixed doors not opening for entities (added kinematic rigidbodies to parents/set box colliders to triggers/tagged all child objects as Entity)
	Created the UpgradeConstants struct to hold upgrade value constants
	Made a public setter for player max health to demonstrate upgrades
	Created UpgradeButton to handle upgrade UI and messaging the upgrade system
	Created UpgradeManager to handle actual upgrades
	Created SaveManager as a placeholder so that the upgrade system is prepared to refer to it and use it; doesn't do any saving itself yet
	Added sound to door
	Updated entity sounds, switched them to Effects audio master output
	Added L_S to splash logos, added cursor and icon
	Added particle effects to entity firing mechanisms

Version 1.20183.01.02
-------------------------
Description
	This version focused on creating basic entity models for testing, implementing more entity AI logic, and implementing UI states.
Tasks Completed
	Added XML summaries to classes
	Create models for the RFTO and PHE entities
	Create sight cone model to use for sight collision
	Change the entity firing location to base off of gameobject position (like with player) and test alternating shot locations
	Change the requirement for NavMeshAgent to be in child classes of Entity rather than Entity itself
	Implemented a way to restart the demo when killed/when entities killed
	Implemented entity death and player death
	Implemented pause option
	Over-wrote MouseLook's behavior for cursor locking (changed FirstPersonController to remove reference to commented-out method) since it conflicts with own methods and future methods of handling the cursor (and other UI)
	Set escape key to pause menu
	Changed how DevelopersConsole is called (goes through HUDManager first)
	Changed headings in all the classes
	Implemented HUDManager
	Implemented improved entity firing mechanism (based on ray)

Version 1.20183.01.01
-------------------------
Description
	This version focused on creating a basic scene for development testing, implementing basic entity AI (both a tracking entity and a following entity), implementing gun firing, and basic decreasing of entity and player health. A developer's console has been created as well for future development purposes.
Tasks Completed
	Create demo scene
	Create weapon class
	Create pistol class
	Test pistol firing mechanism
	Create entity class
	Create RFTO class

	Create player class
	Implement sight cone for entity
	Test player receiving damage
	Implement / Test turret object tracking player
	Implement / Test turret only tracking player if in range/in sight cone
	Implement weapon fire rate (pistol only can fire on ButtonDown and only if timer is greater than fire rate)
	Implement ammo (pistol can only fire if enough ammo present)
	Implement entity fire rate (changes how sight cone works)
	Implement entity that follows player (only in range/in sight cone) and does damage
	Fully create demo scene testing these implementations on a larger scale
	Implement particle/sound effects, distinction materials on entities and gun
	Create development console (takes in commands, splits strings, etc.)
