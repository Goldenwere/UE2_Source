To see current bugs, please see the [UE2 Trello board](https://trello.com/b/JU5xF2yN/unknown-entity-2)

### Project Status

UE2 is in early public alpha. This means that not all features are implemented yet, and the game may potentially have bugs.

### Controls

Rebind controls in Menu -> Controls

#### Movement & Interaction

- WASD/left thumbstick for movement
- Use the mouse/right thumbstick to look around
- To interact with an object, press/hold E/west gamepad button (XInput: X, DualShock: square)
- Left-shift/left thumbstick press to run
- Space/south gamepad button (XInput: A, DualShock: cross) to jump

#### Weapons

- Use left-click/right trigger to fire weapons
- Use tab/east gamepad button (XInput: B, DualShock: circle) to swap weapons

#### Menus

- Use Escape/start to pause the game
- Use left-click/enter/south gamepad button (XInput: A, DualShock: cross) to select a UI option
- Use WASD/Arrow keys/left thumbstick/right thumbstick/dpad to navigate UI without a mouse

### Objective

The HUD shows the current objective. Completing it will update the objective. Currently, repairing a unique room or object completes an objective.

### Gameplay

More details will come soon.

### Console Commands

Left clicking on an object in the scene while the console is open selects an object to focus commands on  
Right clicking resets the focused object (i.e. sets to null)  

Command Description TBA

If a valid command is inputted as the optional parameter, help info is supplied for the specific command  
Entering commands with no parameters that require at least one parameter will do the same as typing help (command~)
